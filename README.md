# tonylin.profile.aws

To build my personal profile on python and flask standing on AWS ElasticBeanstalk , also it's an experiment to compare the difference between deploying/write same code for AWS/GCP

## Rquired Use Case (GCP / AWS)

- [GCP] A landing page using bootstrap
- [GCP] Embed linkedin widet on the landing page
- [GCP] Add a tech section to experiement on new stuff  

## Optional Feature

- [ ] Support for Google Search Console 
- [AWS] add [2017_api_traffic_demo] page and add SocketIO Server to listen realtime api traffics
- [AWS] on [2017_api_traffic_demo] page that visualize the api traffics using sankey diagram (the sankey diagram come from reference section)


## Discovering Innovative 3rd Party Services
